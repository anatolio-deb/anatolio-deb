# About me

I'm a Python/Django developer with a little experience in Vue.js interested in building modern and scalable web applications.

I'm also inspired by Unix design and experienced as a Python software architect for that platform.

I like to log and share my experience on [Medium](https://anatolio.medium.com/) and [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/cybran24/) â€” a Russian IT community.

I've got some of my work open sourced on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/anatolio/).
